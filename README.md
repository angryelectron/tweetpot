Tweetpot posts a message on Twitter to tell followers that the kettle has
boiled.  It is based on the HIH4030 humidity sensor.

The 'arduino' directory contains an HIH4030 library and examples for Arduino
1.0.  The 'java' directory contains a java version of the HIH4030 library and
the tweetpot application, which receives humidity readings via XBee and posts
tweets.
