HIH4030/HIH4031

Given the output of the HIH403X sensor in volts, this class will calculate the
relative humidity.  If temperature is also available, this class will return
the temperature-compensated relative humidity. 

See javadoc for a description of the class and how the formulas were derived.

This 'binary' distribution is just a single class wrapped in a jar for
convenience.  You may want to simply include the HIH403X class in your code.
Source code can be found at http://github.com/angryelectron/tweetpot.  To build
a jar from source, open the project in Netbeans or build using "ant".
