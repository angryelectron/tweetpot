To build the application using Netbeans, simply open the project, compile,
and run.  You may need to specify the java.library.path to the RXTX JNI to run
the application within Netbeans.  You can do this by navigating to the
project's Properties -> Run, then adding
"-Djava.library.path=./resources/<architecture>/<jni>".  See ./resources for a
list of architectures.

The application expects to find an XBee radio attached via FTDI cable.  By
default the application will use /dev/ttyUSB0.  To use another serial port (ie.
COM3), use the -p <port> switch.  Likewise, if your XBee is configured to use a
baud rate other than 9600, you can set it using the -b <baud> switch.
